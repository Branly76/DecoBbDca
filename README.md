# DecoBbDca
This is a simple freqtrade strategy based on onlt the Bollinger Band indicator and DCA.
The example uses only 2 assets. The assets collelarion is weak.
Dca is used.
The backtesting / parameter optimalization is over several years (2022-2024).
Each asset has his own parameter values.
Backtesting is done by the backtesting.py package.

Strategy is now running for about two months and the results are ok.
Time will tell, will update results regularly.
